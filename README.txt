ABOUT THE CourseStorm Class Registration Plugin for WordPress

This free plugin imports, displays, and syncs your CourseStorm class catalog directly within your WordPress website. Students can browse, register, and pay for your classes in just a few clicks.

Set up for this plugin is a breeze.  Just enter your CourseStorm catalog web address and you're done.  It's that simple.

Your students can register for your classes online anytime, increasing your enrollments with no additional work on your part. 

Educational organizations know that the more steps there are in the class registration process, the fewer people will actually finish registering, so we designed CourseStorm to be simple, replacing registration forms, spreadsheets, and hard-to-search catalogs. 

Even nontechnical users can set up this plugin and start taking online registrations within minutes!

**NOTE**
To use this plugin, you must connect to a CourseStorm account.  Don't have one?  No problem. You can [create an account for free](https://www.coursestorm.com/simple-online-registration/?utm_campaign=wordpress-plugin&utm_source=marketplace&utm_medium=wordpress-plugin).

=== ABOUT COURSESTORM ===

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= Where can I find more information about CourseStorm? =
 
You can find more information on the CourseStorm at [https://www.coursestorm.com/simple-online-registration](https://www.coursestorm.com/simple-online-registration/?utm_campaign=wordpress-plugin&utm_source=marketplace&utm_medium=wordpress-plugin).

= How does the plugin work? =
 
The plugin automatically imports your program’s current CourseStorm catalog and creates classes in your WordPress admin area based on the information in your catalog. The plugin syncs with your class catalog every hour, but you can manually sync it as well, should the need arise.

= How does the plugin sync my catalog? How often? =
 
The plugin will sync your catalog in three different ways.

* When you activate the plugin and save your CourseStorm Catalog URL.
* Hourly (or at the specified interval) after you have activated the plugin.
* When you click the ‘Sync now’ button under the ‘Sync Status’ box, which is only available if you have a catalog url saved. It should be used to manually trigger the sync outside of the scheduled hourly sync. (Note: It will not work if the scheduled sync is within 10 minutes of the scheduled hourly sync.)

During the sync, you will see the status of the import as a notice at the top of the WordPress admin. There are three different notices: pending, import progress (including the % complete), and complete.

= How will it look on my theme? =
 
The CourseStorm for WordPress plugin adopts the overall site styles, fonts, and colors.

= Will it work on my theme? =
 
Yes! This plugin works with most standard themes right out of the box with no customization required.  For custom themes, your theme developer or our staff can assist you.

= I’m a developer and would like more customization. Do you have an API? =
 
For customers with more advanced needs, we also offer a fully-open REST API. This provides your web development staff an immense amount of flexibility and power. Using this API, you can not only provide advanced search functionality directly in your site, but also integrate with internal systems for record keeping, data syncing, and more. Our REST API provides secure access to all of your data including courses, students, categories, locations, and instructors.

For more information about our REST API, contact our integration team at [integrations@coursestorm.com](mailto:integrations@coursestorm.com).

Updates to the CourseStorm for WordPress plugin are handled automatically through the WordPress eco-system.  When a new update is available, you will receive a notification in WordPress via the update manager.  Navigating to the updates section of WordPress (Dashboard > Updates) will show the updatable plugin under the ‘Plugins’ heading.  Alternatively, you can update the plugin from the plugins page, by clicking the ‘Update Now’ link below the plugin if an update is available.

= Can I use the plugin to display or register with classes that aren’t on CourseStorm? =
 
No, for the plugin to work, you will need an active CourseStorm account.

= Can I display classes from multiple CourseStorm accounts? =
 
No, you can only display classes from one CourseStorm account on a site at a time, however, we do support WordPress multisite to provide independent catalog display on each site in a network.
